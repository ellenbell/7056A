Welcome! 

This is the workbook for the modules Univariate Statistics and Multivariate Statistics at the University of East Anglia. Please feel free to use this resource for your own learning or teaching, however if you do, I do ask that you cite the resource and let me know you have done so at ellen.bell@uea.ac.uk. This is simply so that I can gage impact and I would be delighted to receive feedback as well, if you have any. # statistics_for_biologists
